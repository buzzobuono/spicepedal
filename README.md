# SpicePedal

SpicePedal is a realtime simple spice-like simulator for audio.

## TODO

- [ ] Which signalOut when solver fail?
- [ ] Move log outside from solver
- [ ] Understand convergence issues in *Wolly Mammoth* circuit
- [x] Add dumpling in Newton-Raphson and measure sistematically performamce: DOESN'T WORK.
- [x] Add voltage clipping to help convergence: DOESN'T WORK.
- [ ] Optimize performamce for real time *solve()* method
- [ ] Implement *getCurrent()* for all component
- [ ] Test Mosfet component in a circuit
- [ ] Test Inductor model in a circuit
- [ ] Adapt project to *c++* best practices
- [x] Refactor *solveDC()* method
- [ ] Better manage *.probe* implementation
- [ ] implement a circuit generic *lv2* plugin
- [ ] enforce netlist number parsing to avoid collision with measure unit
- [ ] enforce univocity in circuit directive
- [ ] use compile-time param to enable/disable statistics collecting 
- [ ] use compile-time param to enable/disable .probe directive (no file production at all)
- [x] add convergence statistics
- [ ] potentiometer direct stamping avoiding temporary resistor allocation
